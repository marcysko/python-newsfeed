# python-newsfeed

## Description

  My first post-boot camp project. Python was used to refactor an existing application that was originally built using Node.js. The app, called Just Tech News https://github.com/marcysko/just-tech-news, is a website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. Instead of using Node.js as the back-end language and Handlebars.js as the templating engine, I used Python to create the app and the Python Flask framework to create the applicationâ€™s views.
